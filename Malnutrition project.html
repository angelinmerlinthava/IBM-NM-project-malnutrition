<b>Description:</b>
Malnutrition occurs when there is an imbalance between the nutrients necessary for your body's
functions and the nutrients it receives. This imbalance can manifest as undernutrition or overnutrition.
Undernutrition may result from insufficient calorie intake or deficiencies in protein, vitamins, or
minerals, while overnutrition can stem from an excess of calories. Malnutrition remains a significant
factor rendering children more susceptible to diseases and mortality.
There are four primary types of malnutrition: wasting, stunting, underweight, and overweight.
Therefore, conducting a comprehensive analysis of malnutrition offers insights into its prevalence and
implications, informing targeted interventions and policies aimed at enhancing nutrition and overall
well-being.
<b>Expected Solutions:</b>
The goal is to utilize the Cognos analytics platform's capabilities to assist stakeholders in obtaining
actionable insights, pinpointing effective interventions, and strategically allocating resources to tackle
malnutrition efficiently. By employing data-driven decision-making and visualizations, we aim to
enhance awareness, instigate policy reforms, and bolster the efficacy of nutrition initiatives, ultimately
reducing the prevalence and repercussions of malnutrition
